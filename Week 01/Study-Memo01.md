# Study memo | WW1
## A class summary
### The course introduction
In the begining of the class, the students were introduced about the course, the teachers and the teaching assistants. A lot of important information was told during that time, a summary of the topics and digital resources that the students are going to use during the course trajectory, such as Microsoft Teams, Gitee and Rain Classroom.

Before talking about the class subject, every student introduced themselfs in a small group activity, having to the their names, hobbies and where they are from.
### Markdown
Markdown is a markup language use to add formating elements to plain text documents, a good text editor with Markdown support is Typora, recommended by the teachers.
* Some basic features of Markdown:

*Italic*: \*Markdown* or \_Markdown_

**Bold**: \*\*Markdown** or \_\_Markdown__

~~Strikethrough~~: \~\~Markdown~~
* Mathematical formulas:
They need to be between two "\$", for example to show $(2+x)*4$ is needed to write "\$(2+x)*4$". Other examples:

  * $\sqrt{3x-1}$ is written like "\$\sqrt{3x-1}$".
  * $\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k)^2$ is is written like "\$\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k)^2$"

### GIT
Git is a distributed version control system, a software tool which helps you to keep track of your code changes.
* How to clone in Gitee?

First you duplicate the project into your account with the fork tool, then clone the duplicated project in your device. Open the Git Bash app and write this:

> git config --global user.name "YourUserName"  
> git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

You need to copy the URL of the cloned project and, also, put it in Git Bash. After that, the project is already in your devide.
> git clone https://gitee.com/user/project.git
